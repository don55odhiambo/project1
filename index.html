<img src="/home/don/Downloads/download.png" alt="black panther">
<p> my name is don odhiambo.i was born in 1998.
    I joined primary school from 2004-2012 and personally what i can say is that my 8 years in primary had so many ups and downs.
     from 2013-2016 was the time i journeyed through the high school life.
    
     I decided to take classes in programming because i love programming and in our current era programming has
    resulted in production of websites and apps that make communications easier and also programming has equally
    promoted and created many job opportunities in our country.
